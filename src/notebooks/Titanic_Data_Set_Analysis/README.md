Titanic Dataset Analysis

On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragedy shocked the world and led to better safety regulations for ships. Here, we ask you to perform the analysis through the exploratory data analysis technique. In particular, we want you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

 
The details of these projects and their scope are listed in the following sections.

Titanic Dataset Analysis

Data acquisition of the Titanic dataset
  *  train dataset
  *  test dataset

Perform the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - for train dataset
  * passengers age distribution
  * passengers survival by age
  * passengers survival breakdown
  * passengers class distribution
  * passengers embarkation   by locations

Titanic Dataset Analysis

Perform machine learning to train the machine model and 
  * create user defined function to load train data set
  * create user defined function to load test data set 
  * create machine model 
  * train the machine
  * predict whether a passenger survived the tragedy or not
  * persist the mode for future re-use
