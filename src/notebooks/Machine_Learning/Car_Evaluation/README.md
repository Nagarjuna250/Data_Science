Tuning Classifier Model with XGBoost
Description

    The used car market has significantly grown in recent times, with clients ranging from used car dealers and buyers. You are provided with a car evaluation dataset that has features like price, doors, safety, and so on.

Objective: You are required to create a robust model that allows stakeholders to predict the condition of a used vehicle.

Actions to Perform:

    * Predict the condition of a vehicle based on its features.
    * Plot the most important features.
    * Train multiple classifiers and compare the accuracy.
    * Evaluate the XGBoost model with K-fold cross-validation.
